Even though there are both CUDA and OPENCL version colabs files, you may need to manually switch CUDA/OPENCL in this line of code depending on what GPU you get with colab. For T4 recommend to use CUDA. For P100, P4 and K80 recommend to use OPENCL.

!cd /content/KataGo/cpp/ && cmake . -DBUILD_MCTS=1 -DUSE_BACKEND=OPENCL && make 

The gtp_example.cfg file can be uploaded manually from local PC to colab folder KataGo/cpp using the folder icon on the left panel.
