Even though there are both CUDA and OPENCL version colabs files, you may need to manually switch CUDA/OPENCL in this line of code depending on what GPU you get with colab. For T4 recommend to use CUDA. For P100, P4 and K80 recommend to use OPENCL. First run !nvidia-smi see what GPU you get and then change CUDA/OPENCL accordingly.

!cd /content/KataGo/cpp/ && cmake . -DBUILD_MCTS=1 -DUSE_BACKEND=OPENCL && make 

The gtp_example.cfg file on this repo can be downloaded to local pc and uploaded manually to colab folder KataGo/cpp using the folder icon on the left panel. See screenshot attached.
